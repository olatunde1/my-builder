      You’re the spark. The one with ideas that can’t be ignored. You think in possibilities, feel deeply motivated by purpose,
      and often sense when change is needed—before anyone else does.
      
      That can feel thrilling. But also... isolating.
      
      People may have called you “too much,” “distracted,” or “scattered.”
      But the truth is: you’re just ahead of the curve. You think fast, move fast, and dream big.

      You’re not wrong. You’re just wired differently—and the world needs that.`,

      You’re a thinker, a planner, a calm presence in the chaos. You have a unique ability to step
      back, assess the situation, and spot the path forward—long before others do.
      
      You’re likely the person friends or coworkers turn to when it’s time to “figure it out.”.
      
      That doesn’t mean you always have it all together. In fact, it can feel exhausting to be the one
      who’s always expected to make the plan.

      You’re not just the planner. You’re the quiet builder who sees structure as power.`,

      You’re the designer behind the scenes. Thoughtful, thorough, and intentional. You don’t chase
      quick wins—you build frameworks, foundations, and solutions that stand the test of time.
      
      People may not always see how much you’re holding—but you’re often the one holding it all
      together.
      
      You value integrity, structure, and depth. You thrive in environments where planning and
      excellence are respected—not rushed.

      You don’t need to be loud to be powerful. You lead by building things that work.`,

      You're not always the loudest voice in the room, but you're often the one people trust to get it
      done right.
      
      You thrive in environments where clarity and reliability matter—and where your contribution isn’t
      just recognized, but relied on.

      the process.
      
     People open up around you. They feel seen, heard, and supported. And while others build
     frameworks or momentum, you build the relationships that make it all work.
      
      Sometimes your gift is loud and expressive. Other times it’s quiet, steady, and behind the
      scenes. Either way—it’s vital.

      You build belonging, and that’s what makes everything else possible.`,
