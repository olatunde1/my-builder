      You’re the spark. The one with ideas that can’t be ignored. You think in possibilities, feel deeply motivated by purpose,
      and often sense when change is needed—before anyone else does.

      People may have called you “too much,” “distracted,” or “scattered.”
      But the truth is: you’re just ahead of the curve. You think fast, move fast, and dream big.

      You’re not wrong. You’re just wired differently—and the world needs that.`,
